# 100-days-of-ML

A non-linear journey of daily machine learning experiments, code snippets, and mini-projects. No rigid syllabusâ€”just consistent, curiosity-driven exploration of ML concepts, tools, and frameworks. Includes:  
* Daily code commits (tutorials, Kaggle kernels, or ad-hoc experiments)
* Bite-sized notes on papers, math, or tutorials  Random projects
* Documentation of failures, learnings, and "Aha!" moments

Tools: Python, Jupyter, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Hugging Face, etc. Goal: Build momentum through small, imperfect actions, not perfection.
